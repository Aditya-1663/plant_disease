Originally from western South America, the tomato was domesticated in Mexico and has become one of the most widely grown vegetables globally. Tomato plants are typically bushy or vining annuals that grow 3-10 feet (0.9-3 m) tall. They have compound leaves with serrated edges and produce yellow flowers that develop into fleshy berries (the tomato fruit). The plants have a distinctive aroma caused by the secretion of terpenes from glandular trichomes on the stems and leaves.",

        <br/> 2. Alternaria tomatophila is more virulent on tomato than A. solani, so in regions where A. tomatophila is found, it is the primary cause of early blight on tomato. However, if A.tomatophila is absent, A.solani will cause early blight on tomato.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Use pathogen-free seed, or collect seed only from disease-free plants..
        <br/>2. Rotate out of tomatoes and related crops for at least two years.
        
        <br/>3. Control susceptible weeds such as black nightshade and hairy nightshade, and volunteer tomato plants throughout the rotation.
        <br/>4. Fertilize properly to maintain vigorous plant growth. Particularly, do not over-fertilize with potassium and maintain adequate levels of both nitrogen and phosphorus.
        <br/>5. Avoid working in plants when they are wet from rain, irrigation, or dew.
        <br/>6. Use drip irrigation instead of overhead irrigation to keep foliage dry.""",



    'Tomato___Late_blight': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Late Blight<br/>
        Late blight is a potentially devastating disease of tomato, infecting leaves, stems and fruits of plants. The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated.              
        <br/> Cause of disease:
        <br/><br/> 1. Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Oomycetes are fungus-like organisms also called water molds, but they are not true fungi.
        <br/> 2. There are many different strains of P. infestans. These are called clonal lineages and designated by a number code (i.e. US-23). Many clonal lineages affect both tomato and potato, but some lineages are specific to one host or the other.
        <br/> 3. The host range is typically limited to potato and tomato, but hairy nightshade (Solanum physalifolium) is a closely related weed that can readily become infected and may contribute to disease spread. Under ideal conditions, such as a greenhouse, petunia also may become infected.""",



    'Tomato___Leaf_Mold': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Leaf Mold<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:
        <br/><br/> 1. Leaf mold is caused by the fungus Passalora fulva (previously called Fulvia fulva or Cladosporium fulvum). It is not known to be pathogenic on any plant other than tomato.
        <br/> 2. Leaf spots grow together and turn brown. Leaves wither and die but often remain attached to the plant.
        <br/> 3. Fruit infections start as a smooth black irregular area on the stem end of the fruit. As the disease progresses, the infected area becomes sunken, dry and leathery.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Use drip irrigation and avoid watering foliage.
        <br/>2. Space plants to provide good air movement between rows and individual plants.
        
        <br/>3. Stake, string or prune to increase airflow in and around the plant.
        <br/>4. Sterilize stakes, ties, trellises etc. with 10 percent household bleach or commercial sanitizer.
        <br/>5. Circulate air in greenhouses or tunnels with vents and fans and by rolling up high tunnel sides to reduce humidity around plants.
        <br/>6. Keep night temperatures in greenhouses higher than outside temperatures to avoid dew formation on the foliage.
        <br/>7. Remove crop residue at the end of the season. Burn it or bury it away from tomato production areas.""",

        <br/> Cause of disease:
        <br/><br/> 1. The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops.
        <br/> 2. They have up to 20 generations per year and are favored by excess nitrogen and dry and dusty conditions.
        <br/> 3. Outbreaks are often caused by the use of broad-spectrum insecticides which interfere with the numerous natural enemies that help to manage mite populations. 
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.
        <br/>2. Do not over-fertilize
        
        <br/>3. Overhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations.""",


    'Tomato___Target_Spo': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Target Spot<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:
        <br/><br/> 1. The fungus causes plants to lose their leaves; it is a major disease. If infection occurs before the fruit has developed, yields are low.
        <br/> 2. This is a common disease on tomato in Pacific island countries. The disease occurs in the screen house and in the field.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base
        <br/>2. Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
        
        <br/>3. Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.
        <br/>4. Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.""",

        <br/> Cause of disease:
        <br/><br/> 1. TYLCV is transmitted by the insect vector Bemisia tabaci in a persistent-circulative nonpropagative manner. The virus can be efficiently transmitted during the adult stages.
        <br/> 2. This virus transmission has a short acquisition access period of 15–20 minutes, and latent period of 8–24 hours.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Currently, the most effective treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties.
        <br/>2. The effectiveness of insecticides is not optimal in tropical areas due to whitefly resistance against the insecticides; therefore, insecticides should be alternated or mixed to provide the most effective treatment against virus transmission.
        
        <br/>3. Other methods to control the spread of TYLCV include planting resistant/tolerant lines, crop rotation, and breeding for resistance of TYLCV. As with many other plant viruses, one of the most promising methods to control TYLCV is the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV.""",




    'Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Mosaic Virus<br/>

        <br/><br/> 1. Tomato mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus can exist for two years in dry soil or leaf debris, but will only persist one month if soil is moist. The viruses can also survive in infected root debris in the soil for up to two years.
        <br/> 2. Seed can be infected and pass the virus to the plant but the disease is usually introduced and spread primarily through human activity. The virus can easily spread between plants on workers' hands, tools, and clothes with normal activities such as plant tying, removing of suckers, and harvest 
        <br/> 3. The virus can even survive the tobacco curing process, and can spread from cigarettes and other tobacco products to plant material handled by workers after a cigarette
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Purchase transplants only from reputable sources. Ask about the sanitation procedures they use to prevent disease.
        <br/>2. Inspect transplants prior to purchase. Choose only transplants showing no clear symptoms.
        
        <br/>3. Avoid planting in fields where tomato root debris is present, as the virus can survive long-term in roots.
        <br/>4. Wash hands with soap and water before and during the handling of plants to reduce potential spread between plants."""
